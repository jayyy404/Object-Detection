# Object Detection with Custom AI Model

This project is a simple object detection system using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow. It can recognize four object classes: **WATERBOTTLE**, **PHONE**, **GLASSES**, and **MOUSE** using images captured from your webcam.

---

## System Description

The system consists of two main scripts:

- **AI Object Detection.py**:  
  - Collects images for each object class using your webcam.
  - Saves images into folders (`img_1`, `img_2`, `img_3`, `img_4`).
  - Trains a CNN model on the collected images and saves the trained model as `my_model.h5`.

- **AI_load.py**:  
  - Loads the trained model.
  - Opens your webcam and performs real-time object detection, displaying the predicted class and confidence for the object in the camera's view.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - opencv-python
  - tensorflow
  - keras
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - keras_preprocessing

You can install all dependencies with:
```sh
pip install matplotlib numpy opencv-python tensorflow keras seaborn scikit-learn keras_preprocessing
```

---

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Prepare Folders

Create the following folders in your project directory:
- `img_1` (for WATERBOTTLE images)
- `img_2` (for PHONE images)
- `img_3` (for GLASSES images)
- `img_4` (for MOUSE images)

### 2. Collect Training Images

Run the training script:
```sh
python "AI Object Detection.py"
```
- The webcam will open.
- Press `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` to save an image to the corresponding class folder.
- Press `q` to quit data collection.

### 3. Train the Model

After quitting, the script will automatically:
- Crop and save the images.
- Preprocess the images.
- Train the CNN model.
- Save the trained model as `my_model.h5`.

### 4. Run Real-Time Detection

Run the detection script:
```sh
python AI_load.py
```
- The webcam will open and display predictions for the detected object in real time.
- Press `q` to quit.

---

## Notes

- Ensure you have enough images for each class for better accuracy.
- You can adjust image size and model parameters in the scripts as needed.
- The system is designed for demonstration and educational purposes.

# 🟢 Object Detection AI System

Welcome to the **Object Detection AI System**!  
This project lets you train a custom AI model to recognize four everyday objects using your webcam and deep learning.

---

## 🚀 System Overview

This system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with **Keras** and **TensorFlow** to detect:

- 🥤 **WATERBOTTLE**
- 📱 **PHONE**
- 👓 **GLASSES**
- 🖱️ **MOUSE**

You can collect your own images, train the model, and run real-time detection—all from your computer!

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Easy Data Collection:** Capture images for each object class using your webcam.
- **Custom Training:** Train a CNN on your own dataset.
- **Live Detection:** See real-time predictions with confidence scores.
- **Visual Feedback:** View sample images and training progress.

## 🏁 How to Use

### 1. **Prepare Folders**

Create four folders in your project directory:
- `img_1` (WATERBOTTLE)
- `img_2` (PHONE)
- `img_3` (GLASSES)
- `img_4` (MOUSE)

### 2. **Collect Training Images**

Run:
```sh
python "AI Object Detection.py"
```
- The webcam will open.
- Press `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` to save an image to the corresponding folder.
- Press `q` to finish collecting images.

### 3. **Train the Model**

After quitting, the script will:
- Crop, resize, and save your images.
- Train the CNN model.
- Save the model as `my_model.h5`.

### 4. **Run Real-Time Detection**

Run:
```sh
python AI_load.py
```
- The webcam will open.
- The system will display predictions and confidence for the object in view.
- Press `q` to quit.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Collect at least 20–30 images per class for better results.
- Use different backgrounds and lighting for more robust training.
- You can adjust image size and model parameters in the scripts.
